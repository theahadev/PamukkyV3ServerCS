# User hook
Updates from a user hook could be like these:

* Update name being `online`, sending online status as string.
* Update name being `profileUpdate`, sending new user profile like `getuser` API.
* Update name being `publicTagChange`, sending user's new public tag as string.

# Chats list hook
Updates from a chatslist hook are usually like this:

* Update key containing the chat ID (or the group ID).
* If update value is `"DELETED"`, it would mean that the chat was removed from the list.
* Else, the value would be like a normal chat item and it would mean that it was added.
